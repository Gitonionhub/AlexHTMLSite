	<h1 class = title1>Water Pollution</h1>
	<h2 class = subtitle1>Looking at the goals 6.6 and 14.1, we will find that they have one main perpetrator in common. Water Pollution.</h2>
	<p> Water pollution is making water undrinkable, usually because of human activities, which in most cases will affect other people. Water pollution reduces the ability of the body  of water to provide the ecosystem services that it would otherwise provide to us.</p>

	<h2 id="Goal14P2">Nutrient Pollution</h2>
	<p class="answerblue"> Nutrient Pollution, unlike the section above is not caused by humans. However, it does have a huge impact and is something we could eliminate. Nutrient Pollution happens when a water gets too many nutrients, including nitrogen and phosphorus. This causes a huge growth in Algae. Algae blocks light that is needed for plants, such as seagrasses, to grow. That in turn can kill sea animals such as crabs.</p>
	<img src="npoll.jpeg" class="imagecenter3">
	<p class="answerblue">You can see here one such example of nutrient pollution. We see the huge growth in Algae, blocking the sunlight that is needed to let plants underneath the ocean live. If left untreated, the fish and other marine animals in this body of water will die because of the food supply slowly being eliminated.</p>

Other factors including climate change or invasive species could attribute to the majority of the change. However, exactly half of goal 14.1 is caused by humans. Marine Debris is caused almost entirely by humans. However, nutrient pollution is not! As you can/have read, Nutrient Pollution happens when a water gets too many nutrients. This is not caused by humans but by the enviorment itself. However, both these goals can be SOLVED by humans, using our own means of prevention and restoration.</td>
